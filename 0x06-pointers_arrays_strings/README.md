# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings




## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), without the help of Google
## Description
What is this project about;

- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables


## Tasks
#### [0. strcat](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/0-strcat.c)

- Write a function that concatenates two strings.
- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strcat`. Run `man strcat` to learn more.
#### [1. strncat](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/1-strncat.c)

- Write a function that concatenates two strings.
- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strncat`. Run `man strncat` to learn more.
#### [2. strncpy](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strncpy.c)


- Write a function that copies a string.
- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strncpy`. Run `man strncpy` to learn more.
#### [3. strcmp](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/3-strcmp.c)

- Write a function that compares two strings.
- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strcmp`. Run `man strcmp` to learn more.
#### [4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/4-rev_array.c)

- Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
#### [5. Always look up](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/5-string_toupper.c)

- Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
#### [6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/6-cap_string.c)

- Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

#### [7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/7-leet.c)

- Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.
