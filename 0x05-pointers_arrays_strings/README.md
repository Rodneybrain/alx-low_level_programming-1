# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings




#### Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:
- [Pointers and Arrays](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/60) 
- [Data Structures](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/120)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), without the help of Google
## Description
What is this project about;

- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables


## Tasks
#### [0. 98 Battery st.](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c)

- Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
#### [1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c)

- Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
#### [2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c)

- Write a function that returns the length of a string.
- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strlen`. Run `man strlen` to learn more.
#### [3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c)

- Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `puts`. Run `man puts` to learn more.
#### [4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c)

- Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
#### [5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c)

- Write a function that reverses a string.
#### [6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c)

- Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

#### [7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c)

- Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
#### [8. Arrays are not pointers](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c)

- Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
#### [9. strcpy](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c)

- Write a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `strcpy`. Run `man strcpy` to learn more.

## More Info
You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, arrays of structures, `malloc` and `free` - yet.
