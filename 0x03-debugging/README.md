Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as `gdb` or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.
## Description
What is this project about;

- What is debugging
- What are some methods of debugging manually
- How to read the error messages
## Tasks
#### [0. Multiple mains](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/0-main.c)

- In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
#### [1. Like, comment, subscribe](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/1-main.c)

- Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
#### [2. 0 > 972?](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/2-largest_number.c)

- This program prints the largest of three integers.
#### [3. Leap year](https://github.com/modyy-14/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c)

- This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
